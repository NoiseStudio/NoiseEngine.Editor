# GUI editor of NoiseEngine
**More about project is described in [main repository](https://github.com/NoiseStudio/NoiseEngine).**

## Why this repository is empty?
Currently we do not focus on editor, because we have more important things to do in engine now. We run this repository in future.

## Plans
We want to create editor not in GTK etc. We want to use NoiseEngine. Why? Because it good idea to test it better and add more new features.

## License
NoiseEngine.Editor is licensed under the [MIT](/LICENSE) license.
